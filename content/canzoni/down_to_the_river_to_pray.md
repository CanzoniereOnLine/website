As I went |down in the river to pray
studying about that good ol' way.
And who shall wear the starry crown?
Good Lord show me the way!


O sisters let's go down
let's go down, come on down.
O sisters let's go down,
down in the river to pray.


As I went down in the river to pray
studying about that good ol' way.
And who shall wear the robe \& crown?
Good Lord show me the way.


O brothers let's go down
let's go down, come on down.
Come on brothers, let's go down
Down in the river to pray.


As I went down in the river to pray
studying about that good ol' way.
And who shall wear the starry crown?
Good Lord show me the way!


O fathers let's go down

O fathers let's go down
Down in the river to pray.


As I went down in the river to pray
studying about that good ol' way.

Good Lord show me the way.


O mothers let's go down
Come on down, don't you wanna go down?
Come on mothers, let's go down
