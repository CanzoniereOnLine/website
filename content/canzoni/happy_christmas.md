And so this is Christmas 
Another year over, a new one just begun;
And so this is Christmas, 
the near and the dear ones, 
A merry, merry Christmas, 
Let's hope it's a good one,  


And so this is Christmas 
for weak and for strong 
The rich and the poor ones 
the road is so long. 
And so, happy Christmas 
for black and for white 
For the yellow and red ones 
Let's stop all the fights. 


A merry, merry Christmas,
Let's hope it's a good one, 
And so this is Christmas
Another year over,
And so this is Christmas,
the near and the dear ones,
A merry, merry Christmas,
Let's hope it's a good one, 


And so this is Christmas 
for weak and for strong 
The rich and the poor ones 
the road is so long. 
And so, happy Christmas 
for black and for white 
For the yellow and red ones 
Let's stop all the fights. 


A merry, merry Christmas,
Let's hope it's a good one, 
War is over, if you want it
