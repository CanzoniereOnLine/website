And so this is Christmas brk and what have you done?  
Another year over, a new one just begun;  
And so this is Christmas, brk I hope you have fun  
the near and the dear ones, brk the old and the young.  
A merry, merry Christmas, brk and a happy New Year,  
Let's hope it's a good one,  brk without any fear   
  
  
And so this is Christmas echo  
for weak and for strong echo  
The rich and the poor ones echo  
the road is so long. echo  
And so, happy Christmas echo  
for black and for hite echo  
For the yellow and red ones echo  
Let's stop all the ghts. echo
